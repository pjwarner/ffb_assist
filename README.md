ffb_assist
==========

This is an app that I started to help me with some of the basic research that I was doing on a weekly basis
for my fantasy football league.  Currently all data is coming from the nfl.com.  All the fantasy points data is
pulled directly from the site just to get everything up and running.

Current Functionality
==

* Pull down your team (Update as required) Does require a code hack to pull up your team from nfl.com
* Calculate player position avg against opp def

Road Map (No specific order)
* Calculate fan points based on custom scoring
* Pull team data from [yahoo, fleaflicker, espn, etc]
* More robust UI (maybe make it web based)
